This Handbook highlights relationship marketing as an area of growing interest and ongoing development within marketing, providing key insights that illustrate its important role in guiding customer-directed business strategies. Relationship marketing is an approach to increase long-term profitability through loyal customers. With increased customer retention, fewer resources need to be invested in acquiring new customers and marketing costs go down. The Handbook on Relationship Marketing brings together contributions from some of the leading figures in the field to analyze the role of marketing with suppliers and customers, as well as internal and lateral partners. The Handbook will appeal to scholars and students of marketing and business. It will also be a useful resource for practitioners looking to exploit relationship marketing for better customer retention.","520  ":"","588  .a":"Description based on online resource; title from title screen (viewed January 13, 2015).","588  ":"","650 0.a":"Relationship marketing.","650 0":"","655 0.a":"Electronic books.","655 0":"","7001 .a":"Morgan, Robert M.","7001 ":"","7001 .a":"Parish, Janet Turner.","7001 ":"","7001 .a":"Deitz, George.","7001 ":"","7102 .a":"Edward Elgar Publishing.","7102 ":"","7761 .z":"9781848443686 (hardback)","7761 ":"","830 0.a":"Elgar original reference.","830 0":"","85640.u":"https://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781848443686.xml","85640":""}

The highly competent Greek and British co-authors of this book answer in the affirmative. They demonstrate the close and vicious interrelationships between human attitudes and behavior on the one hand, and unemployment, overemployment, poverty, mortgage default and human ill health and suffering on the other. We need to learn from this important book's recent and scarring lessons.'--Lennart Levi, Member of the Swedish Parliament 2006-2010, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. 'This book is a must for those who want to understand in detail the profound impact and emotional toll the economic crisis had on individuals, organizations and the nature of work. No part of society has been left untouched. The books strength lies not just in the mapping of the costs and consequences but in the well-being agenda it sets for the future.'--Philip Dewe, University of London, UK. 'This volume is timely. As the authors note, the global economic recession of 2008, from which we are still recovering, looks very much like the Great Depression of the late 1920s. They identify several causes of the 2008 crisis and consider individual and organizational costs of these events. These costs, compounded by changes in the larger organizational and global context, will last a long time. Their guidance on improving individual, organizational and societal health is workable.'--Ronald J. Burke, Schulich School of Business, York University, Canada. The global economic crisis of 2008 caused the collapse of the world's financial institutions, large-scale unemployment, the devaluing of housing stocks leading to mortgage defaults and left many countries in debt, unable to meet their financial obligations. The consequences of this in the workplace were substantial and for those who remained employed, longer working hours, heavier workloads, an insecure working environment and micro-management became manifest. Examining the impact of the recession on organizations and individuals at work, this book explores the long lasting effect the crisis will have on workplaces for the future. The book is divided into three parts: in Part I, a historical economic review is provided for the reader. In Part II, an assessment is given on how occupational stress in the 21st Century has impacted the working environment in a host of negative ways. In Part III, the authors address unique coping strategies to be applied at the individual, organizational and societal levels in the future. An insightful and thorough account of how the economic crisis has unfolded on an international scale is presented and the profound psychological impact that this recession has had on the workplace assessed. Such comprehension will be invaluable for students and academics in the social sciences, organisational and social psychologists and practitioners of occupational health.","520  ":"","588  .a":"Description based on online resource; title from title screen (viewed January 13, 2015).","588  ":"","650 0.a":"Job stress","650 0.x":"Economic aspects.","650 0":"","650 0.a":"Job stress","650 0.x":"Health aspects.","650 0":"","650 0.a":"Global Financial Crisis, 2008-2009","650 0.x":"Psychological aspects.","650 0":"","655 0.a":"Electronic books.","655 0":"","7001 .a":"Cooper, Cary L.","7001 ":"","7102 .a":"Edward Elgar Publishing.","7102 ":"","7761 .z":"9781781000496 (hardback)","7761 ":"","830 0.a":"New horizons in management.","830 0":"","85640.u":"https://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781781000496.xml","85640":""}

Customer equity has emerged as the most important metric to manage firm performance and value. The Handbook of Research on Customer Equity in Marketing explores the tactical and strategic issues related to understanding, measuring, managing and implementing this tool. Customer equity is the total combined customer lifetime values of all of a company's customers and includes Value Equity, Brand Equity and Relationship Equity. It determines the true value of a company in that it considers the future revenue of the customer base relative to other companies. Through a combination of perspectives, this Handbook analyzes the topic and considers risk alongside strategy and offers state-of-the-art research on the field. Covering all bases, it begins with exploring the evolution of customer equity and concludes with implications of customer equity implication for the future.

Once the prime example of a Nordic welfare state, Sweden's labour market is now a highly individualized competitive arena. With attention to detail as well as global trends, this important book describes the dismantling of the Swedish welfare state across various arenas where being employable is increasingly framed as an individual responsibility. This book offers unique insight into current shifts from state to market, from institutional loyalty to marketing of self.'--Marianne Lien, University of Oslo, Norway. 'What remains of the emblematic Swedish model of the welfare state? Taking the example of labor market policy, Makeshift Work brings to light a major shift: from the commodification of work to the commodification of workers. In depth empirical investigations into the institutional and individual consequences of this shift make this book a reference for understanding the current transformations in Swedish society and more generally brings into focus the challenges facing Europe as a whole.'--Bénédicte Zimmermann, EHESS, France. 'The rise and development of the Swedish model of labour market policy has been thoroughly dealt with in many important social science and economic analyses, but the present dismantling of the model and its consequences have only started to be understood. This book is therefore an extremely important contribution in that it combines concrete analyses of changes in the infrastructure of employment services and of the implications thereof from a human perspective.'--Jan Ch. Karlsson, Karlstad University, Sweden. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, people who had never before had cause to worry about losing their jobs entered the ranks of the unemployed for the first time. In Sweden, the welfare state has been radically challenged and mass unemployment has become a reality in what used to be viewed as a model case for a full employment society. With an emphasis on Sweden in the context of transnational regulatory change, Makeshift Work in a Changing Labour Market discusses how the market mediates employment and moves on to explore the ways in which employees adjust to a new labour market. Focusing on the legibility, measurability and responsibility of jobseekers, the expert contributors to this book bring together an analysis of activation policy and new ways of organizing the mediation of work, with implications for the individual jobseeker. Students and researchers of labour market policy, the organization of markets and work and society both in Sweden and abroad will find this book to be of interest. Policy makers will find the empirical examples of policy processes among employees an extremely useful and insightful tool.","520  ":"","588  .a":"Description based on online resource; title from title screen (viewed January 13, 2015).","588  ":"","650 0.a":"Labor market","650 0.z":"Sweden.","650 0":"","650 0.a":"Employability","650 0.z":"Sweden.","650 0":"","650 0.a":"Welfare state","650 0.z":"Sweden.","650 0":"","651 0.a":"Sweden","651 0.x":"Social policy.","651 0":"","651 0.a":"Sweden","651 0.x":"Social conditions.","651 0":"","655 0.a":"Electronic books.","655 0":"","7001 .a":"Garsten, Christina.","7001 ":"","7001 .a":"Lindvert, Jessica.","7001 ":"","7001 .a":"Thedvall, Renita.","7001 ":"","7102 .a":"Edward Elgar Publishing.","7102 ":"","7761 .z":"9781783479733 (hardback)","7761 ":"","85640.u":"https://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781783479733.xml","85640":""}

The Handbook highlights the requirement for new perspectives on theory and managerial practice to better comprehend this phenomenon. Internationalizing firms from emerging markets are sweeping the global economy. Here, expert contributors offer interesting insight into emerging market multinationals' internationalization drivers, growth processes and expansion, and underscore similarities and differences between developed and emerging country internationalizing firms. Case studies from emerging market economies are presented, including corporations from China, Egypt, India, Thailand, Russia, and South Africa. Revised perspectives on internationalization theory are proposed, addressing changing global value chain configurations, institutional distance between home and host countries, the role of governments and preferred modes of entry into foreign markets. This theoretical, empirical and conceptual work is a fundamental point of reference for students and academics interested in business, economics and internationalization theory.

Asia is undergoing rapid developments in markets, sources of technology and user preferences. This book provides an empirical understanding and initial conceptualization of these dynamic processes, including the role of multinational enterprises, entrepreneurship and public policy. The accomplished contributors explore case studies of entrepreneurs and large companies in Asia in order to discuss the ways in which customers, institutions and firms, both domestic and foreign, are interacting to affect global processes of innovation and production. Innovation spaces are analyzed within Asian countries and firms, from Asia to the world, and from the world to Asian countries. Students and researchers pursuing innovation, international business and entrepreneurship will find this to be a useful read. This book will also be of interest to innovation managers and public policy practitioners looking for a thorough guide on the topic.","520  ":"","588  .a":"Description based on online resource; title from title screen (viewed March 5, 2015).","588  ":"","650 0.a":"Technological innovations","650 0.z":"Asia.","650 0":"","651 0.a":"Asia","651 0.x":"Economic conditions.","651 0":"","655 7.a":"Electronic books.","655 7.2":"lcsh","655 7":"","7001 .a":"McKelvey, Maureen.","7001 ":"","7001 .a":"Bagchi-Sen, Sharmistha.","7001 ":"","7102 .a":"Edward Elgar Publishing.","7102 ":"","7761 .z":"9781783475674 (hardback)","7761 ":"","85640.u":"https://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781783475674.xml","85640":""}
